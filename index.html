            <p>Once upon a time there were three little pigs who lived outdoors near the forest. They often felt uneasy because an evil and dangerous wolf used to pass by there and threaten to eat them. One day they agreed that the most prudent thing was for each of them to build a house to be more protected.</p>

            <p>The smallest pig, who was very lazy, decided that his house would be made of straw. For a few hours he dedicated himself to stacking dry straws and in no time, he built his new home. Satisfied, he went off to play. I'm no longer afraid of the big bad wolf! He told his brothers.</p>

            <p>The medium pig was a little more determined than the small one but he didn't really want to work either. He thought that a wooden house would be enough to be safe, so he went into the forest and hauled all the logs he could to build the walls and the roof. In a couple of days he had finished it and very happy, he went to chat with other animals. Excellent! I'm not afraid of the big bad wolf either, he commented to everyone he met.</p>
