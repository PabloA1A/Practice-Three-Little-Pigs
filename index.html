            <p>Once upon a time there were three little pigs who lived outdoors near the forest. They often felt uneasy because an evil and dangerous wolf used to pass by there and threaten to eat them. One day they agreed that the most prudent thing was for each of them to build a house to be more protected.</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/casa paja.jpeg" alt="straw house" class="cerditos">
            <p>The smallest pig, who was very lazy, decided that his house would be made of straw. For a few hours he dedicated himself to stacking dry straws and in no time, he built his new home. Satisfied, he went off to play. I'm no longer afraid of the big bad wolf! He told his brothers.</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/casa madera.jpeg" alt="wooden house" class="cerditos">
            <p>The medium pig was a little more determined than the small one but he didn't really want to work either. He thought that a wooden house would be enough to be safe, so he went into the forest and hauled all the logs he could to build the walls and the roof. In a couple of days he had finished it and very happy, he went to chat with other animals. Excellent! I'm not afraid of the big bad wolf either, he commented to everyone he met.</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/casa ladrillo.jpeg" alt="brick house" class="cerditos">
            <p>The eldest of the brothers, on the other hand, was sensible and had very good ideas. He wanted to make a comfortable but above all indestructible house, so he went to the city, bought bricks and cement, and began building his new home. Day after day, the little pig worked hard to make the best house possible. His brothers didn't understand why he went to so much trouble. Look at our brother! The small pig said to the medium one â€“ He spends the day working instead of coming to play with us. Well yes. What nonsense! I don't know why he works so hard and can do it in no time... Our houses have turned out phenomenal and are as valid as his. The oldest pig, he heard them. Well, when the wolf comes we will see who has been the most responsible and smart of the three, he told them as a warning. It took him several weeks and it was exhausting work, but it was definitely worth the effort. When the brick house was finished, the eldest of the brothers felt proud and sat down to contemplate it while he drank a refreshing lemonade. How good my house has turned out! Not even a hurricane can stop her.</p>
