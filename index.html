            <p>Once upon a time there were three little pigs who lived outdoors near the forest. They often felt uneasy because an evil and dangerous wolf used to pass by there and threaten to eat them. One day they agreed that the most prudent thing was for each of them to build a house to be more protected.</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/casa paja.jpeg" alt="straw house" class="cerditos">
            <p>The smallest pig, who was very lazy, decided that his house would be made of straw. For a few hours he dedicated himself to stacking dry straws and in no time, he built his new home. Satisfied, he went off to play. I'm no longer afraid of the big bad wolf! He told his brothers.</p>

            <p>The medium pig was a little more determined than the small one but he didn't really want to work either. He thought that a wooden house would be enough to be safe, so he went into the forest and hauled all the logs he could to build the walls and the roof. In a couple of days he had finished it and very happy, he went to chat with other animals. Excellent! I'm not afraid of the big bad wolf either, he commented to everyone he met.</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/casa ladrillo.jpeg" alt="brick house" class="cerditos">
            <p>The eldest of the brothers, on the other hand, was sensible and had very good ideas. He wanted to make a comfortable but above all indestructible house, so he went to the city, bought bricks and cement, and began building his new home. Day after day, the little pig worked hard to make the best house possible. His brothers didn't understand why he went to so much trouble. Look at our brother! The small pig said to the medium one. He spends the day working instead of coming to play with us. Well yes. What nonsense! I don't know why he works so hard and can do it in no time... Our houses have turned out phenomenal and are as valid as his. The oldest pig, he heard them. Well, when the wolf comes we will see who has been the most responsible and smart of the three, he told them as a warning. It took him several weeks and it was exhausting work, but it was definitely worth the effort. When the brick house was finished, the eldest of the brothers felt proud and sat down to contemplate it while he drank a refreshing lemonade. How good my house has turned out! Not even a hurricane can stop her.</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/lobo casa paja.jpeg" alt="wolf blowing the straw house" class="cerditos">
            <p>Each little pig went to live in its own home. Everything seemed calm until one morning, the youngest, who was playing in a mud puddle, saw the fearsome wolf appear in the bushes. The poor pig began to run and took refuge in his brand new straw house. He closed the door and breathed a sigh of relief. But from within he heard the wolf shout: I will blow and I will blow and I will tear down the house! And just as he said it, he began to blow and the little straw house fell apart.</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/lobo casa madera.jpeg" alt="wolf blowing the wooden house" class="cerditos">
            <p>The little pig, terrified, ran towards his middle brother's house and they both took refuge there. But the wolf appeared after a few seconds and shouted: I will huff and puff and I will blow the house down! It blew so hard that the wooden structure began to move and in the end all the logs that made up the house fell and began to roll down the slope.</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/lobo casa de ladrillo.jpeg" alt="wolf blowing the brick house" class="cerditos">
            <p>The brothers, desperate, fled at high speed and knocked on their older brother's door, who opened it and let them in, locking the door. Don't worry, guys, you'll be fine here. The wolf won't be able to destroy my house. The fearsome wolf arrived and no matter how hard he blew, he could not move a single brick from the walls. It was a very sturdy house!</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/lobo entrando por chimenea.jpeg" alt="wolf entering through the chimney" class="cerditos">
            <p>Even so, he did not give up and looked for a hole through which he could enter. At the back of the house there was a century-old tree. The wolf climbed up and with one jump, landed on the roof and from there jumped to the chimney.</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/lobo con la cola quemada.jpeg" alt="wolf with burnt tail" class="cerditos">
            <p>He slid down it to enter the house but fell on a huge pot of broth that was being heated on the fire. The burn was so great that he let out a piercing howl and was thrown back to the roof. With his ass reddened, he fled, never to return. Do you see what has happened? the eldest pig scolded his brothers. You have narrowly escaped falling into the wolf's clutches! That makes you lazy and unconscious. You have to think about things before doing them. First there is the obligation and then the fun. I hope you have learned your lesson.</p>

            <img src="./public/assets/img/cerditos end.jpeg" alt="the three happy little pigs" class="cerditos">
            <p>And of course they did! From that day on they became more responsible, they built a brick and cement house like their wise older brother's and they lived happily and peacefully forever.</p>
