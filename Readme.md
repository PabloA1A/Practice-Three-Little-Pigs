# Git & Github - Little Red Riding Hood

You will need to create a Github repository called “Practice-Git-Little-Red-Riding-Hood” or “Practice-Three-Little-Pigs” in which you will upload the exercise performed in your local repository.

## Requirements:
- Using html code you must tell the story of the little red riding hood.
- You must make the relevant commits and push them to the repository (WARNING - The when and why of the commits is important).
- You can spice up your story with images
- Of course you can style it with CSS
- Activate Github Pages
